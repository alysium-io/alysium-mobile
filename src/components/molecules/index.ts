 * @description
 * The purpose of this module is to create reusable components that essentially define theme,
 * style & feel of the application. These are components like text inputs which might have some sort
 * of animated border, an icon on the left, and a placeholder text. These components are usually composed
 * of multiple different atomic components and present more as an interactable component than a simple
 * programming tool.
